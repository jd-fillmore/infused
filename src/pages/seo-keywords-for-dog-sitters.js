                  A big part in finding the best SEO keywords for dog sitter
                  comes down to a couple things:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    What are your customers searching for, in terms of your dog
                    sitters?
                  </li>
                  <li>What city are you located in?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Since local{" "}
                  <Link href="/seo">search engine optimization</Link> is going
                  to be so huge for you as a dog sitter (since you offer a local
                  service), it's super important to build an SEO keyword{" "}
                  <Link href="/digital-strategy">digital strategy</Link> for
                  your business.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  The entire point of SEO is inbound marketing - that is, to
                  bring clients that are looking for what you offer, directly to
                  you. SEO for a dog sitter works so well because even when
                  times are tough - recessions, slow times - it doesn't matter.
                  You're tapping into a market that's outside of your network
                  (people you don't know), who are looking for exactly what you
                  offer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>
                    Some of the best keywords for dog sitters are:
                  </strong>
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>"your city + dog sitter"</li>
                    <li>"your city + dog sitter rates" </li>

                <h2>So.. what are the best SEO keywords for dog sitters?</h2>
                <p>
                  In this short post, we'll go through some SEO keyword ideas
                  that are the best to use for dog sitters.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + dog sitter"</h2>
                <p>
                  You'll notice a pattern as we go through these keywords.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Since most dog sitters deal with clients locally, you will
                  want to target local people that are searching for your
                  services.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  If you're in Toronto, you want to show up when someone
                  searches "Toronto dog sitters" or "dog sitter Toronto".
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  If you're in Los Angeles, "dog sitter LA" or "Los Angeles dog
                  sitter".
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  These are a bit harder to rank for, because they're such
                  generic terms. Not to mention, since every other dog sitter is
                  using SEO to try and rank for that keyword, it's super
                  competitive.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Which leads us to something called a long-tail keyword.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + dog sitter"</h2>
                <p>
                  Long tail keywords are usually phrases of four or more words.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  These are so much easier to rank for in Google because they're
                  longer phrases, therefore they're less competitive in nature.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Below, we'll dive even deeper or go into what's known as
                  "buyer's intent" when it comes to searching.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + in home dog sitter"</h2>
                <p>
                  Here, people Google not only for an dog sitter within their
                  city.. but a specific type. A in home dog sitter. See how much
                  more specific, and with that more intention of buying this
                  phrase entails?
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  It's been proven that the more specific that a search term is,
                  the more intent there is for a person to buy.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + puppy dog sitter"</h2>
                <p>
                  You can see the same sort of effect being played out above.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  I'm in Toronto (City) looking to for a puppy dog sitter.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The more specific the search, the more ready-to-buy your
                  customers are.
                </p>
                <h2>"Dog sitters near me" or "puppy dog sitter near me"</h2>
                <p>
                  This one is a bit funny.
                  <br />
                  <br />A lot of people surprisingly use this search term. It's
                  pretty difficult to rank for - but if you can, you're tapping
                  into a fairly large market of people using SEO to search for
                  what you offer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                  "Best dog sitters + city" or "best puppy dog sitters + city"
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Not only is there intent in this search, but you know they're
                  not tire kickers.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  When someone uses words like "Best", you know that they know
                  that with that, comes money to spend. Which is great for you.
                  In conclusion, these are some of the best SEO keywords for dog
                  sitters and walkers.
