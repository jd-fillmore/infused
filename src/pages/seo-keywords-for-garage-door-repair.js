                  A big part in finding the best SEO keywords for garage door
                  repair companies comes down to a couple things:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    What are your customers searching for, in terms of your
                    garage door repair?
                  </li>
                  <li>What city are you located in?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Since local{" "}
                  <Link href="/seo">search engine optimization</Link> is going
                  to be so huge for you as a garage door repair company (since
                  you offer a local service), it's super important to build an
                  SEO keyword{" "}
                  <Link href="/digital-strategy">digital strategy</Link> for
                  your business.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  The entire point of SEO is inbound marketing - that is, to
                  bring clients that are looking for what you offer, directly to
                  you. SEO for garage door repair or installation companies
                  works so well because even when times are tough - recessions,
                  slow times - it doesn't matter. You're tapping into a market
                  that's outside of your network (people you don't know), who
                  are looking for exactly what you offer.

                  So.. what are the best SEO keywords for garage door repair
                  &amp; installation companies?
                </h2>
                <p>
                  In this short post, we'll go through some SEO keyword ideas
                  that are the best to use for garage door repair &amp;
                  installation companies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                  "City + garage door repair" or "city + garage door
                  installation company"
                </h2>
                <p>
                  You'll notice a pattern as we go through these keywords.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Since most Garage Door Repair &amp; Installation Companies
                  deal with clients locally, you will want to target local
                  people that are searching for your services.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  If you're in Toronto, you want to show up when someone
                  searches "Toronto garage door repair" or "Toronto garage door
                  installation".
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  If you're in Los Angeles, "garage door repair &amp; LA" or
                  "Los Angeles garage door installation".
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  These are a bit harder to rank for, because they're such
                  generic terms. Not to mention, since every other garage door
                  repair or installation company is using SEO to try and rank
                  for that keyword, it's super competitive.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Which leads us to something called a long-tail keyword.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + garage door repair company"</h2>
                <p>
                  Long tail keywords are usually phrases of four or more words.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  These are so much easier to rank for in Google because they're
                  longer phrases, therefore they're less competitive in nature.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Below, we'll dive even deeper or go into what's known as
                  "buyer's intent" when it comes to searching.
                </p>
                <h2>
                  "City + overhead garage door repair company" or "city +
                  overhead garage door installation company"
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Here, people Google not only for a garage door repair or
                  installation company.. but a specific type. An overhead garage
                  door repair company. See how much more specific, and with that
                  more intention of buying this phrase entails?
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  It's been proven that the more specific that a search term is,
                  the more intent there is for a person to buy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                  "City + garage door opener repair" or "city + garage door
                  opener repair company"
                </h2>
                <p>
                  You can see the same sort of effect being played out above.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  I'm in Toronto (City) looking to get a garage door opener
                  repair work done (garage door repair) and looking for a
                  company (garage door opener repair company) to do it.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The more specific the search, the more ready-to-buy your
                  customers are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                  "Garage door repair near me" or "garage door repair company
                  near me"
                </h2>
                <p>
                  This one is a bit funny.
                  <br />
                  <br />A lot of people surprisingly use this search term. It's
                  pretty difficult to rank for - but if you can, you're tapping
                  into a fairly large market of people using SEO to search for
                  what you offer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                  "Best garage door repair company + city" or "best garage door
                  installation + city"
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Not only is there intent in this search, but you know they're
                  not tire kickers.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  When someone uses words like "Best", you know that they know
                  that with that, comes money to spend. Which is great for you.
                  In conclusion, these are some of the best SEO keywords for
                  Garage Door Repair Companies.
