                  works so well because even when times are tough - recessions,
                  slow times - it doesn't matter. You're tapping into a market
                  that's outside of your network (people you don't know), who
                  are looking for exactly what you offer.

                  So.. what are the best SEO keywords for auto glass shops?
                </h2>
                <p>
                  In this short post, we'll go through some{" "}
                  <Link to="/seo-port-colborne">SEO</Link> keyword ideas that
                  are the best to use for auto glass shops.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + auto glass shops"</h2>
                <p>
                  You'll notice a pattern as we go through these keywords.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Since most auto glass shops deal with clients locally, you
                  will want to target local people that are searching for your
                  services.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  If you're in Toronto, you want to show up when someone
                  searches "Toronto auto glass shops" or "auto glass shops
                  Toronto".
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  If you're in Los Angeles, "auto glass shops LA" or "Los
                  Angeles auto glass shops".
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  These are a bit harder to rank for, because they're such
                  generic terms. Not to mention, since all other auto glass
                  shops are using <Link to="/seo-thorold">SEO</Link> to try and
                  rank for that keyword, it's super competitive.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Which leads us to something called a long-tail keyword.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + mobile auto glass shops"</h2>
                <p>
                  Long tail keywords are usually phrases of four or more words.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  These are so much easier to rank for in Google because they're
                  longer phrases, therefore they're less competitive in nature.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Below, we'll dive even deeper or go into what's known as
                  "buyer's intent" when it comes to searching.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + repair auto glass shops"</h2>

                  <br />

                  the more intent there is for a person to buy.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + window repair auto glass shops"</h2>

                  You can see the same sort of effect being played out above.

                  <br />
                  I'm in Toronto (City) looking to for window repair auto glass

                <p>
