            <h2>Our Beamsville Web Design Helps Boost Your Credibility &amp; Sales</h2>
            <p>There are countless benefits as to how site can help not only your business, but really any business. But, lets keep the focus on yours for now.</p>
            <h4>A 24/7, full times salesperson</h4>
            <p>
              Imagine you did not have a website. Better yet, imagine your website had a terrible design and a terrible user experience. Meaning - it wasn't attractive, it wasn't personable and people couldn't find what they're looking for. An overall embarrassment to interact with and look at.
              <br>
              <br>Now imagine your website was the total opposite. It looked amazing on devices (desktop, laptop, tablet and phone), it was super easy to navigate, and it was far more beautiful than your competitions.
              <br>
              <br>In what situation do you think your potential customers are buying from you?
              <br>
              <br>Better design, better user experience = increase in sales.
            </p>
            <h4>ROI</h4>
            <p>
              The great thing is that everything is translated into
              <em>trackable</em> results. We're able to track pretty much every aspect of your website - month to month reports that record analytics pertaining to increase in Google rankings, overall traffic and exactly how many conversions you had.
            </p>
            <h4>Cost Effectiveness</h4>
            <p>Investing in a site is bar-none, THE most cost-effective marketing tool in today's modern digital world. The reason for this is that is simple - the sheer impact and potential your website has on the amount of business that it brings in. The inbound marketing nature of a great site saves countless man hours and cost versus something like cold calling, direct mail campaigns and other outbound marketing strategies.</p>
            <h4>Qualified Leads</h4>
            <p>
              This is probably one of the biggest advantages of an amazing site - you get people that
              <em>need</em> your service, and they're so impressed by what they see that it's a no brainer to contact you. Gone are the days of spending thousands on outbound marketing, in hopes that you
              <em>might</em> get some customers. Now, when people contact you via your awesome web design, you KNOW that they're interested and that they are absolutely ready to buy.

              First, we'll get together for a 10 - 15 minute
              <a href="/contact">discovery call</a>. This call is used to flesh out the current problems your having (if you already have a website up), and also to talk about your business goals and what you expect your website to do / accomplish.

            <h4>How does your pricing work?</h4>
            <p>This completely depends on what you want. For example - is it an informational site? Will you be selling a product or service on the website? Are there any types of custom functionality you wish to use? After these questions are answered, we'll be in a better spot to give you a choice between packages.</p>

          <div class="col-md-4">
            <h4>Is there a contract?</h4>
            <p>Yes. The contract lasts for the length of the project. Once the website is launched and everything is complete, the contract ends. Unless, you want to sign up for website maintenance or security - which is highly recommended.</p>
