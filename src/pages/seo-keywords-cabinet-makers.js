                <p>
                  A big part in finding the best SEO keywords for cabinet maker
                  comes down to a couple things:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    What are your customers searching for, in terms of your
                    cabinet maker business?
                  </li>
                  <li>What city are you located in?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Since local{" "}
                  <Link href="/seo">search engine optimization</Link> is going
                  to be so huge for you as a cabinet maker (since you offer a
                  local service), it's super important to build an SEO keyword{" "}
                  <Link href="/digital-strategy">digital strategy</Link> for
                  your business.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  The entire point of SEO is inbound marketing - that is, to
                  bring clients that are looking for what you offer, directly to
                  you. SEO for a cabinet maker works so well because even when
                  times are tough - recessions, slow times - it doesn't matter.
                  You're tapping into a market that's outside of your network
                  (people you don't know), who are looking for exactly what you
                  offer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>
                    Some of the best keywords for cabinet makers are:
                  </strong>
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>"your city + cabinet maker"</li>
                    <li>"your city + cabinet maker company" </li>
                    <li>"your city + kitchen cabinet maker"</li>
                    <li>"your city + wood cabinet maker"</li>
                    <li>"cabinet makers near me"</li>
                    <li>
                      "best cabinet makers + your city" or "best will and
                      testament cabinet maker + your city"

                <h2>So.. what are the best SEO keywords for cabinet makers?</h2>
                <p>
                  In this short post, we'll go through some SEO keyword ideas
                  that are the best to use for cabinet makers.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + cabinet maker"</h2>
                <p>
                  You'll notice a pattern as we go through these keywords.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Since most cabinet makers deal with clients locally, you will
                  want to target local people that are searching for your
                  services.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  If you're in Toronto, you want to show up when someone
                  searches "Toronto cabinet makers" or "cabinet maker Toronto".
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  If you're in Los Angeles, "cabinet maker LA" or "Los Angeles
                  cabinet maker".
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  These are a bit harder to rank for, because they're such
                  generic terms. Not to mention, since every other cabinet maker
                  is using SEO to try and rank for that keyword, it's super
                  competitive.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Which leads us to something called a long-tail keyword.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + cabinet maker company"</h2>
                <p>
                  Long tail keywords are usually phrases of four or more words.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  These are so much easier to rank for in Google because they're
                  longer phrases, therefore they're less competitive in nature.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Below, we'll dive even deeper or go into what's known as
                  "buyer's intent" when it comes to searching.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + kitchen cabinet maker"</h2>
                <p>
                  Here, people Google not only for an cabinet maker within their
                  city.. but a specific type. A kitchen cabinet maker. See how
                  much more specific, and with that more intention of buying
                  this phrase entails?
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  It's been proven that the more specific that a search term is,
                  the more intent there is for a person to buy.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + wood cabinet maker"</h2>
                <p>
                  You can see the same sort of effect being played out above.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  I'm in Toronto (City) looking to for a wood cabinet maker.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The more specific the search, the more ready-to-buy your
                  customers are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                  "Cabinet makers near me" or "wood cabinet maker near me"
                </h2>
                <p>
                  This one is a bit funny.
                  <br />
                  <br />A lot of people surprisingly use this search term. It's
                  pretty difficult to rank for - but if you can, you're tapping
                  into a fairly large market of people using SEO to search for
                  what you offer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                  "Best cabinet makers + city" or "best wood cabinet makers +
                  city"
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Not only is there intent in this search, but you know they're
                  not tire kickers.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  When someone uses words like "Best", you know that they know
                  that with that, comes money to spend. Which is great for you.
                  In conclusion, these are some of the best SEO keywords for
                  cabinet makers.
