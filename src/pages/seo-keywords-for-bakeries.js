                  A big part in finding the best{" "}
                  <Link href="/seo-beamsville">SEO</Link> keywords for bakeries
                  comes down to a couple things:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    What are your customers searching for, in terms of your
                    bakery?
                  </li>
                  <li>What city are you located in?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Since local{" "}
                  <Link href="/seo-crystal-beach">
                    search engine optimization
                  </Link>{" "}
                  is going to be so huge for you as a bakery (since you offer a
                  local service), it's super important to build an{" "}
                  <Link href="/seo-fonthill">SEO</Link> keyword{" "}
                  <Link href="/digital-strategy">digital strategy</Link> for
                  your business.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  The entire point of <Link href="/seo-fort-erie">SEO</Link> is
                  inbound marketing - that is, to bring clients that are looking
                  for what you offer, directly to you.{" "}
                  <Link href="/seo-grimsby">SEO</Link> for a bakery works so
                  well because even when times are tough - recessions, slow
                  times - it doesn't matter. You're tapping into a market that's
                  outside of your network (people you don't know), who are
                  looking for exactly what you offer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Some of the best keywords for bakeries are:</strong>
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>"your city + bakery"</li>
                    <li>"your city + bakeries" </li>
                    <li>"your city + vegan bakery"</li>
                    <li>"your city + italian bakery"</li>
                    <li>"bakeries near me"</li>
                    <li>
                      "best bakeries + your city" or "best vegan bakery + your
                      city"
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                <h2>So.. what are the best SEO keywords for bakeries?</h2>
                <p>
                  In this short post, we'll go through some{" "}
                  <Link href="/seo-port-colborne">SEO</Link> keyword ideas that
                  are the best to use for bakeries.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + bakeries"</h2>
                <p>
                  You'll notice a pattern as we go through these keywords.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Since most bakeries deal with clients locally, you will want
                  to target local people that are searching for your services.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  If you're in Toronto, you want to show up when someone
                  searches "Toronto bakeries" or "bakery Toronto".
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  If you're in Los Angeles, "bakery LA" or "Los Angeles bakery".
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  These are a bit harder to rank for, because they're such
                  generic terms. Not to mention, since every other bakery is
                  using <Link href="/seo-thorold">SEO</Link> to try and rank for
                  that keyword, it's super competitive.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Which leads us to something called a long-tail keyword.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + french bakery"</h2>
                <p>
                  Long tail keywords are usually phrases of four or more words.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  These are so much easier to rank for in Google because they're
                  longer phrases, therefore they're less competitive in nature.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Below, we'll dive even deeper or go into what's known as
                  "buyer's intent" when it comes to searching.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + vegan bakery"</h2>
                <p>
                  Here, people Google not only for a bakery within their city..
                  but a specific type. A vegan bakery. See how much more
                  specific, and with that more intention of buying this phrase
                  entails?
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  It's been proven that the more specific that a search term is,
                  the more intent there is for a person to buy.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + italian bakery"</h2>
                <p>
                  You can see the same sort of effect being played out above.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  I'm in Toronto (City) looking to for an Italian bakery.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The more specific the search, the more ready-to-buy your
                  customers are.
                </p>
                <h2>"bakeries near me" or "french bakery near me"</h2>
                <p>
                  This one is a bit funny.
                  <br />
                  <br />A lot of people surprisingly use this search term. It's
                  pretty difficult to rank for - but if you can, you're tapping
                  into a fairly large market of people using{" "}
                  <Link href="/seo-welland">SEO</Link> to search for what you
                  offer.
                </p>
                <h2>"Best bakeries + city" or "best vegan bakeries + city"</h2>
                <p>
                  Not only is there intent in this search, but you know they're
                  not tire kickers.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  When someone uses words like "Best", you know that they know
                  that with that, comes money to spend. Which is great for you.
                  In conclusion, these are some of the best SEO keywords for
                  bakeries.
