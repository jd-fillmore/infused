                <h3>What is SEO?</h3>
                <p>
                  Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the process of increasing
                  your <Link href="/websites">websites</Link> visibility within
                  Google's search results. If your website is on the first page

                  the 10th page, you will get a lot more customers.
                </p>
                <h3>Do I need SEO?</h3>
                <p>
                  Does your business depend on attracting new customers? Then
                  absolutely you need a Welland SEO company to help you with SEO
                  services. It's important that our Welland SEO experts help

                  first page of Google.
                </p>
                <h3>What's important when it comes to SEO?</h3>
                <p>
                  There's about 200 ranking signals that Google evaluates a
                  website on when it comes to SEO. The top factors here are
                  domain authority (how old your website's domain is), the
                  quality SEO content of your website, SEO backlinks going to
                  your website, technical SEO coding on your site and more. We
                  will clearly identify the strengths and weaknesses in terms of
                  SEO that your current website has, and come up with a game
                  plan to improve.
                </p>
                <h3>How long does SEO take?</h3>
                <p>
                  There are many variables and depends on the website. For
                  example - a brand new website can take upwards to a year to
                  start seeing any meaningful results. A website that has been
                  around for a longer amount of time could start seeing movement
                  within 2-3 months. It all depends on your website's standing
                  when it comes to SEO.
                </p>
                <h3>How do I get on the Google Map Pack?</h3>
                <p>
                  The Google Map Pack is great for local SEO. This is the area
                  where when someone searches, local companies pop up with 5
                  star reviews. If you do local SEO and get in the top 3 of this
                  map pack, you're golden. The best way to get there is to
                  optimize your Google My Business profile. We specialize in
                  doing so and can help you rise up in the local SEO map pack
                  rankings.
