                  is going to be so huge for you as an HVAC &amp; AC repair
                  company (since you offer a local service), it's super

                  The entire point of <Link href="/seo-fort-erie">SEO</Link> is
                  inbound marketing - that is, to bring clients that are looking
                  for what you offer, directly to you.{" "}
                  <Link href="/seo-grimsby">SEO</Link> for HVAC &amp; AC repairs
                  works so well because even when times are tough - recessions,
                  slow times - it doesn't matter. You're tapping into a market
                  that's outside of your network (people you don't know), who
                  are looking for exactly what you offer.

                  So.. what are the best SEO keywords for HVAC &amp; AC repair?
                </h2>
                <p>
                  In this short post, we'll go through some{" "}
                  <Link href="/seo-port-colborne">SEO</Link> keyword ideas that
                  are the best to use for HVAC &amp; AC repair.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + HVAC &amp; AC repair"</h2>
                <p>
                  You'll notice a pattern as we go through these keywords.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Since most HVAC &amp; AC repair companies deal with clients
                  locally, you will want to target local people that are
                  searching for your services.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  If you're in Toronto, you want to show up when someone
                  searches "Toronto HVAC &amp; AC repair" or "Toronto hot HVAC
                  &amp; AC repair company".
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  If you're in Los Angeles, "HVAC &amp; AC repair LA" or "Los
                  Angeles HVAC &amp; AC repair".
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  These are a bit harder to rank for, because they're such
                  generic terms. Not to mention, since every other HVAC &amp; AC
                  repair or HVAC &amp; AC repair company is using{" "}
                  <Link href="/seo-thorold">SEO</Link> to try and rank for that
                  keyword, it's super competitive.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Which leads us to something called a long-tail keyword.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + HVAC &amp; AC repair company"</h2>
                <p>
                  Long tail keywords are usually phrases of four or more words.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  These are so much easier to rank for in Google because they're
                  longer phrases, therefore they're less competitive in nature.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Below, we'll dive even deeper or go into what's known as
                  "buyer's intent" when it comes to searching.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + HVAC heat pump"</h2>
                <p>
                  Here, people Google not only for a HVAC &amp; AC repair within
                  their city.. but a specific type. A heat pump. See how much
                  more specific, and with that more intention of buying this
                  phrase entails?
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  It's been proven that the more specific that a search term is,
                  the more intent there is for a person to buy.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + HVAC heating &amp; cooling"</h2>
                <p>
                  You can see the same sort of effect being played out above.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  I'm in Toronto (City) looking to go to a heating &amp; cooling
                  work done (HVAC heating &amp; cooling).
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The more specific the search, the more ready-to-buy your
                  customers are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                  "HVAC &amp; AC repairs near me" or "HVAC &amp; AC repair
                  company near me"
                </h2>
                <p>
                  This one is a bit funny.
                  <br />
                  <br />A lot of people surprisingly use this search term. It's
                  pretty difficult to rank for - but if you can, you're tapping
                  into a fairly large market of people using{" "}
                  <Link href="/seo-welland">SEO</Link> to search for what you
                  offer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                  "Best HVAC &amp; AC repairs + city" or "best HVAC &amp; AC
                  repair company + city"
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Not only is there intent in this search, but you know they're
                  not tire kickers.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  When someone uses words like "Best", you know that they know
                  that with that, comes money to spend. Which is great for you.
                  In conclusion, these are some of the best SEO keywords for
                  HVAC &amp; AC repairs.
