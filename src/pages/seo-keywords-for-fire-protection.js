                  A big part in finding the best SEO keywords for fire
                  protection companies comes down to a couple things:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    What are your customers searching for, in terms of fire
                    protection?
                  </li>
                  <li>What city are you located in?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Since local <Link to="/seo">search engine optimization</Link>{" "}
                  is going to be so huge for you as a fire protection company
                  (since you offer a local service), it's super important to
                  build an SEO keyword{" "}
                  <Link to="/digital-strategy">digital strategy</Link> for your
                  business.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  The entire point of SEO is inbound marketing - that is, to
                  bring clients that are looking for what you offer, directly to
                  you. SEO for fire protection companies works so well because
                  even when times are tough - recessions, slow times - it
                  doesn't matter. You're tapping into a market that's outside of
                  your network (people you don't know), who are looking for
                  exactly what you offer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>
                    Some of the best keywords for fire protection companies are:

                  So.. what are the best SEO keywords for fire protection &amp;
                  fire protection companies?
                </h2>
                <p>
                  In this short post, we'll go through some SEO keyword ideas
                  that are the best to use for fire protection &amp; fire
                  protection companys.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + fire protection"</h2>
                <p>
                  You'll notice a pattern as we go through these keywords.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Since most fire protection &amp; fire protection companies
                  deal with clients locally, you will want to target local
                  people that are searching for your services.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  If you're in Toronto, you want to show up when someone
                  searches "Toronto fire protection" or "Toronto fire protection
                  company".
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  If you're in Los Angeles, "fire protection company LA" or "Los
                  Angeles fire protection".
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  These are a bit harder to rank for, because they're such
                  generic terms. Not to mention, since every other fire
                  protection or fire protection company is using SEO to try and
                  rank for that keyword, it's super competitive.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Which leads us to something called a long-tail keyword.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + fire protection company"</h2>
                <p>
                  Long tail keywords are usually phrases of four or more words.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  These are so much easier to rank for in Google because they're
                  longer phrases, therefore they're less competitive in nature.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Below, we'll dive even deeper or go into what's known as
                  "buyer's intent" when it comes to searching.
                </p>
                <h2>
                  "City + sprinkler specialist" or "city + fire protection
                  sprinkler specialist"
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Here, people Google not only for an an fire protection or fire
                  protection company within their city.. but a specific type of
                  fire protection. A fire protection sprinkler specialist. See
                  how much more specific, and with that more intention of buying
                  this phrase entails?
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  It's been proven that the more specific that a search term is,
                  the more intent there is for a person to buy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                  "City + fire protection extinguisher servicing" or "city +
                  fire protection extinguisher servicing company"
                </h2>
                <p>
                  You can see the same sort of effect being played out above.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  I'm in Toronto (City) looking to get extinguisher servicing
                  work done and looking for a fire protection company to do it.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The more specific the search, the more ready-to-buy your
                  customers are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                  "Fire protection near me" or "fire protection company near me"
                </h2>
                <p>
                  This one is a bit funny.
                  <br />
                  <br />A lot of people surprisingly use this search term. It's
                  pretty difficult to rank for - but if you can, you're tapping
                  into a fairly large market of people using SEO to search for
                  what you offer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                  "Best fire protection company + city" or "best fire protection
                  + city"
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Not only is there intent in this search, but you know they're
                  not tire kickers.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  When someone uses words like "Best", you know that they know
                  that with that, comes money to spend. Which is great for you.
                  In conclusion, these are some of the best SEO keywords for
                  fire protection &amp; fire protection companies.
