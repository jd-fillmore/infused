                <p>
                  A big part in finding the best SEO keywords for event planners
                  comes down to a couple things:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    What are your customers searching for, in terms of your
                    event planner?
                  </li>
                  <li>What city are you located in?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Since local{" "}
                  <Link href="/seo">search engine optimization</Link> is going
                  to be so huge for you as a event planner (since you offer a
                  local service), it's super important to build an SEO keyword{" "}
                  <Link href="/digital-strategy">digital strategy</Link> for
                  your business.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  The entire point of SEO is inbound marketing - that is, to
                  bring clients that are looking for what you offer, directly to
                  you. SEO for a event planner works so well because even when
                  times are tough - recessions, slow times - it doesn't matter.
                  You're tapping into a market that's outside of your network
                  (people you don't know), who are looking for exactly what you
                  offer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>
                    Some of the best keywords for event planners are:
                  </strong>
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>"your city + event planners"</li>
                    <li>"your city + wedding event planner" </li>
                    <li>"your city + party event planner"</li>
                    <li>"your city + anniversary event planner"</li>
                    <li>"event planners near me"</li>
                    <li>
                      "best event planners + your city" or "best event planner
                      practice + your city"
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Lets go a bit indepth below and understand why those are the
                    best keywords for your event planner business.

                <h2>So.. what are the best SEO keywords for event planners?</h2>
                <p>
                  In this short post, we'll go through some SEO keyword ideas
                  that are the best to use for event planners.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + event planners"</h2>
                <p>
                  You'll notice a pattern as we go through these keywords.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Since most event planners deal with clients locally, you will
                  want to target local people that are searching for your
                  services.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  If you're in Toronto, you want to show up when someone
                  searches "Toronto event planners" or "event planner Toronto".
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  If you're in Los Angeles, "event planner LA" or "Los Angeles
                  event planner".
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  These are a bit harder to rank for, because they're such
                  generic terms. Not to mention, since every other event planner
                  is using SEO to try and rank for that keyword, it's super
                  competitive.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Which leads us to something called a long-tail keyword.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + event planner practice"</h2>
                <p>
                  Long tail keywords are usually phrases of four or more words.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  These are so much easier to rank for in Google because they're
                  longer phrases, therefore they're less competitive in nature.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Below, we'll dive even deeper or go into what's known as
                  "buyer's intent" when it comes to searching.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + party event planner"</h2>
                <p>
                  Here, people Google not only for a event planner within their
                  city.. but a specific type. An party event planner. See how
                  much more specific, and with that more intention of buying
                  this phrase entails?
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  It's been proven that the more specific that a search term is,
                  the more intent there is for a person to buy.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + anniversary event planner"</h2>
                <p>
                  You can see the same sort of effect being played out above.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  I'm in Toronto (City) looking to for a anniversary event
                  planner.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The more specific the search, the more ready-to-buy your
                  customers are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                  "Event planners near me" or "local event planner near me"
                </h2>
                <p>
                  This one is a bit funny.
                  <br />
                  <br />A lot of people surprisingly use this search term. It's
                  pretty difficult to rank for - but if you can, you're tapping
                  into a fairly large market of people using SEO to search for
                  what you offer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                  "Best event planners + city" or "best local event planners +
                  city"
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Not only is there intent in this search, but you know they're
                  not tire kickers.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  When someone uses words like "Best", you know that they know
                  that with that, comes money to spend. Which is great for you.
                  In conclusion, these are some of the best SEO keywords for
                  event planners.
