                  companies comes down to a couple things:

                  is going to be so huge for you as a boating company (since you
                  offer a local service), it's super important to build an{" "}

                  The entire point of <Link href="/seo-fort-erie">SEO</Link> is
                  inbound marketing - that is, to bring clients that are looking
                  for what you offer, directly to you.{" "}
                  <Link href="/seo-grimsby">SEO</Link> for a boating company
                  works so well because even when times are tough - recessions,
                  slow times - it doesn't matter. You're tapping into a market
                  that's outside of your network (people you don't know), who
                  are looking for exactly what you offer.

                  <strong>
                    Some of the best keywords for boating companies are:

                  <br />
                  <br />

                  keywords for boating company?
                </h2>
                <p>
                  In this short post, we'll go through some{" "}
                  <Link href="/seo-port-colborne">SEO</Link> keyword ideas that
                  are the best to use for boating company.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + boating"</h2>
                <p>
                  You'll notice a pattern as we go through these keywords.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Since most boating companies deal with clients locally, you
                  will want to target local people that are searching for your
                  services.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  If you're in Toronto, you want to show up when someone
                  searches "Toronto boating services" or "Toronto boating
                  company".
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  If you're in Los Angeles, "boating company LA" or "Los Angeles
                  boating company".
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  These are a bit harder to rank for, because they're such
                  generic terms. Not to mention, since every other boating
                  company is using <Link href="/seo-thorold">SEO</Link> to try
                  and rank for that keyword, it's super competitive.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Which leads us to something called a long-tail keyword.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + boating company"</h2>
                <p>
                  Long tail keywords are usually phrases of four or more words.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  These are so much easier to rank for in Google because they're
                  longer phrases, therefore they're less competitive in nature.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Below, we'll dive even deeper or go into what's known as
                  "buyer's intent" when it comes to searching.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + electric boating company"</h2>
                <p>
                  Here, people Google not only for a boating company within
                  their city.. but a specific type. A electric boating company.
                  See how much more specific, and with that more intention of
                  buying this phrase entails?
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  It's been proven that the more specific that a search term is,
                  the more intent there is for a person to buy.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + yacht boating companies"</h2>
                <p>
                  You can see the same sort of effect being played out above.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  I'm in Toronto (City) looking to for a local boating company
                  (local boating services).
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The more specific the search, the more ready-to-buy your
                  customers are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                  "Boating companies near me" or "electric boating company near
                  me"
                </h2>
                <p>
                  This one is a bit funny.
                  <br />
                  <br />A lot of people surprisingly use this search term. It's
                  pretty difficult to rank for - but if you can, you're tapping
                  into a fairly large market of people using SEO to search for
                  what you offer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                  "Best boating companies + city" or "best yacht boating
                  companies + city"
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Not only is there intent in this search, but you know they're
                  not tire kickers.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  When someone uses words like "Best", you know that they know
                  that with that, comes money to spend. Which is great for you.
                  In conclusion, these are some of the best SEO keywords for
                  boating companys.
