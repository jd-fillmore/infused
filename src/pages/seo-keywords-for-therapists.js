                <p>
                  A big part in finding the best SEO keywords for therapists
                  comes down to a couple things:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    What are your customers searching for, in terms of
                    therapists?
                  </li>
                  <li>What city are you located in?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Since local <Link to="/seo">search engine optimization</Link>{" "}
                  is going to be so huge for therapists (since you offer a local
                  service), it's super important to build an SEO keyword{" "}
                  <Link to="/digital-strategy">digital strategy</Link> for your
                  business.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  The entire point of SEO is inbound marketing - that is, to
                  bring clients that are looking for what you offer, directly to
                  you. SEO for a therapists works so well because even when
                  times are tough - recessions, slow times - it doesn't matter.
                  You're tapping into a market that's outside of your network
                  (people you don't know), who are looking for exactly what you
                  offer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Some of the best keywords for therapists are:</strong>
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>"your city + therapists"</li>
                    <li>"your city + marriage therapists" </li>
                    <li>"your city + relationship therapists"</li>
                    <li>"your city + cognitive behavioral therapists"</li>
                    <li>"therapists near me"</li>
                    <li>
                      "best therapists + your city" or "best cognitive
                      behavioral therapists + your city"
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Lets go a bit indepth below and understand why those are the
                    best keywords for therapists.

                <h2>So.. what are the best SEO keywords for therapists?</h2>
                <p>
                  In this short post, we'll go through some SEO keyword ideas
                  that are the best to use for therapists.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + therapists"</h2>
                <p>
                  You'll notice a pattern as we go through these keywords.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Since most therapists deal with clients locally, you will want
                  to target local people that are searching for your services.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  If you're in Toronto, you want to show up when someone
                  searches "Toronto therapists" or "therapists Toronto".
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  If you're in Los Angeles, "therapists LA" or "Los Angeles
                  therapists".
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  These are a bit harder to rank for, because they're such
                  generic terms. Not to mention, since all other therapists are
                  using SEO to try and rank for that keyword, it's super
                  competitive.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Which leads us to something called a long-tail keyword.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + marriage therapists"</h2>
                <p>
                  Long tail keywords are usually phrases of four or more words.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  These are so much easier to rank for in Google because they're
                  longer phrases, therefore they're less competitive in nature.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Below, we'll dive even deeper or go into what's known as
                  "buyer's intent" when it comes to searching.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + relationship therapists"</h2>
                <p>
                  Here, people Google not only for an therapists within their
                  city.. but a specific type. relationship therapists. See how
                  much more specific, and with that more intention of buying
                  this phrase entails?
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  It's been proven that the more specific that a search term is,
                  the more intent there is for a person to buy.
                </p>
                <h2>"City + cognitive behavioral therapists"</h2>
                <p>
                  You can see the same sort of effect being played out above.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  I'm in Toronto (City) looking to for cognitive behavioral
                  therapists.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The more specific the search, the more ready-to-buy your
                  customers are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                  "Therapists near me" or "cognitive behavioral therapists near
                  me"
                </h2>
                <p>
                  This one is a bit funny.
                  <br />
                  <br />A lot of people surprisingly use this search term. It's
                  pretty difficult to rank for - but if you can, you're tapping
                  into a fairly large market of people using SEO to search for
                  what you offer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                  "Best therapists + city" or "best cognitive behavioral
                  therapists + city"
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Not only is there intent in this search, but you know they're
                  not tire kickers.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  When someone uses words like "Best", you know that they know
                  that with that, comes money to spend. Which is great for you.
                  In conclusion, these are some of the best SEO keywords for
                  therapists.
