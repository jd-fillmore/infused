## 3 best practices for high-converting CTA buttons

Before we dive into 3 of the best practices for high-converting CTA buttons, lets answer a few vital questions as it pertains to CTAs (call-to-action) buttons.

## What is a CTA button?

A call-to-action button is button that prompts the user to do something.

For example - if you're a plumber, the main point of having a high-converting button is for people to click on it for a free quote. 

On the other hand if you have an e-commerce website, a high-converting 'buy now' button is important to increase sales.

## What makes a call-to-action button high-converting?

Any old button doesn't mean that it suddenly makes people click on it.

In order to make a call-to-action button high-converting, you need to make it compelling, place it logically on a page and make it stand out.

Lets go through the 3 best practices for high-converting CTA buttons below.

## 1. Compelling copy

In order for a CTA button to be high-converting, it needs to have strong text. And it needs to be straight to the point.

CTA buttons don't convert well when they have a lot of copy. Ones that work well have less copy, and directly tell the user to do something.

Examples of high-converting copy:

* Learn
* Start
* Build
* Join
* Discover

These words imply action, therefore are effective.

## 2. Logical placement

One of the worst things you can do for any call-to-action button is to place them in places that don't make sense.

Also having too many buttons on a page distracts people, and makes it ineffective.

It's kind of like bolding - if everything is bolded, nothing stands out. Likewise if there's too many call-to-actions, none of them stand out.

One of the best practices for high-converting call-to-action buttons are placing them in places where they make sense.

For example - right when a user hits your website, you would have a compelling title quickly explaining what your company does and how it can benefit your customer.

And right under that, put a nice call to button with a strong adjective that compels the user to click.

Another example is if you're offering an incentive - a free quote, a discount, anything.

Directly under it, place the call-to-action.

It makes sense to place call-to-action buttons in these areas, as people have short attention spans. Right when you offer an incentive, place the high-converting CTA button right underneath.

You'll be guarenteed to get some clicks.

## 3. Stand out colour-wise

Having a dull button doesn't work.

A dull button meaning lacking in colour. If your button reflects the same sort of dominant colour that's on the right of your website, it's not going to stand out.

Therefore, it's not going to be a high-converting CTA button.

But - if you have a call-to-action button that is a complimentary colour to the rest of your website's main colour, it absolutely will stand-out.

Make sure to choose a colour of button that makes sense according to the colour wheel, and one that is more or less brighter than your main website's colour. It will be sure to be high-converting.

## Final thoughts on the 3 best practices for high-converting CTA buttons

The main point of a website is to convert users into paying customers.

A big part of that is making sure to follow the best practices for a high-converting call-to-action button. 

If you have CTA buttons on your site that have compelling copy, are placed logically on your pages and stand out colour-wise, the chances of them converting are high.
