<h2>How can search engine optimization help my business?</h2>

Without further ado, lets go ahead and see how search engine optimization can help your business!

Sometimes you might a little bit of website traffic trickling in from your social media, whenever you post something. Other times, you'll get a bit of traffic to your business website if you show your website to family or friends.

But the majority of searches online have been <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/organic-search-sees-largest-growth-rate-2-years-report/236479/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">steadily increasing</a>, and at this point, make up the most part of search today.

What does this mean?

This means that when your customers need something, especially if they are in search of the product or service that you are offering, they go straight to Google and search for it.

This is why it is super important that you have a website that has it's <a href="https://infused.agency/search-engine-optimization/">search engine optimization</a> up to snuff and performing well. Because if your website is not search engine optimized at all, you can count on getting exactly zero business from it!

Since organic search is the primary source of all website traffic, it only makes complete sense to have your website ranking for multiple keyword terms that your customers are trying to find you for.
<h2>SEO is a huge help for local businesses</h2>

<a href="https://www.lyfemarketing.com/blog/local-seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">95% of people search on Google for a local business</a> whenever they are interested in buying a product or service.

So that means that if 95% of your customers are looking for the product or service that you offer, and you're not there - and to make matters worse, your competitors are there? Your competitors are getting all of that business. Not you.

In order for you to adapt as a business in today's world, you need to be found in Google. If you don't establish your local, online presence within the keywords that people search for on Google, your business will go under. That's just the way it is.

So what's the solution? In order to help your business, you need to <a href="https://infused.agency/contact/">hire a firm</a> that specializes search engine optimization. That firm (us!) will help you figure out what keywords you need to rank for locally, and help your website rank for those specific terms.
<h3>Search engine optimization will help build trust &amp; credibility</h3>

Think about it.

If you Google a term like, "sports shoes Toronto", you're only going to browse the websites that are on page one of Google.

What does this mean for you? What does it mean for the businesses that you are browsing?

Simple. What those businesses ranking on page one of Google tell you, is that you can trust them. It tells you that they have credibility in your eyes, because they cared enough to be put in front of you.

All of the other businesses that are on page 2 and beyond - how can you see credibility in them? How can you see trust in them?

You can't.

Businesses that put search engine optimization at the top of their list in terms of marketing, budget and time investment, understand that the return they will get on their investment and added trust and credibility they will get from their customers, is just a no brainer.

They know that if they continue to put effort into their search engine optimization efforts, that it will pay off in the long run for their business. Because that is what search engine optimization is - it's a long game. And has a great long term pay-off for any business.

The more keyword searches that you show up for in Google, the more trust and credibility that you show toward your prospects.
<h2>It creates a better user experience for your business</h2>

What is user experience? (Or, "UX" for short)?

User experience is how difficult or easy the experience is for the user on your website - in terms of finding what they are looking for.

The best websites on the internet have amazing user experience. The worst websites have the worst user experience.

If your website is setup with search engine optimization in mind from the get go, this correlates exactly with a better overall user experience. It is because your website is structure properly with search engine optimization best practices, and therefore, your user experience inherits that.
<h2>Local search engine optimization = more customers</h2>

If your business website does one thing really, really well, it should have local search engine optimization in place.

Like I stated above - the only way that you can get more organic, local business online, is if your website is optimized locally with best search engine practices. If it's not, you won't be getting anyone local contacting you. Instead, they will be going to your competitors.

The better search engine optimization practices that you have on your site, targeting local customers, the more traffic and customers you will see.
<h2>SEO will have great ROI for your business</h2>

The return on your investment for search engine optimization is out of this world.

Would you spend $1,000 to make $10,000? I know I would.

That's the type of return on your investment you get with search engine optimization for your business. Say you're a landscaper - and your average job is between 10-50 thousand.

If you just got one customer from your website using SEO, it pays for itself. The fruits of the SEO labour are so great, you would almost think there's a catch (there's not).

Search engine optimization works just that well.
<h2>So... How can search engine optimization help your business?</h2>

We've seen multiple ways how search engine optimization can your help your business above. It goes without saying that since organic search is the highest type of search performed today, that 95% of your local customers are looking for you, and that SEO has a great return on investment, it's a no brainer to invest in SEO.
