As a web design company, we often get clients asking us why their website isn't converting leads into customers.

In other words they may ask, "why is my website not bringing in new business?". At a glance you may have a 'nice website' - but if it's not hitting your business goals (bringing you new business, new leads, new sign-ups etc.), it's not doing it's job.

In this post, we'll answer the question of "why is my website not bringing in new business?". By the end of this post, you should have a pretty good idea as to why.

**TL;DR - "Why Is My Website Not Bringing In New Business?"**

* **It's not setup to convert**
* **It doesn't rank well in Google**
* **Your design / message doesn't align with your customers**

Without further ado, lets go why your website is not bringing in new business.

## It's not setup to convert

Gone are the days are just putting up a Squarespace, Wix, WordPress etc. website and calling it a day.

And by calling it a day, we mean it 'being effective'.

The bloodline of any company is revenue. If you're website is not bringing in any new business, it's simply not doing it's job. 

A big part of having a website that converts well - or at all - is making sure that it's setup to do so. Website builders as mentioned above don't do this for you. And even a lot of web design agencies don't care about making your website convert, they just care about pumping out new client websites as fast as possible. We've seen it time and time again.

There's many different strategies that you can setup a website to convert in general, or more importantly specific to your industry and audience. If you employ these strategies on your site ([we can help with that](/get-started/)), you'll notice a huge difference. You'll notice people actually reaching out to you for your services or product.

## It doesn't rank well in Google

If you're a local business, and you do not rank on the first page of Google or in Google Maps for local keywords, you're dead in the water.

It's that simple.

Your competition who does rank on the first page of Google and Google Maps, will be getting all of the new business. 

A big reason why your business isn't getting any new business, is because your business isn't visible where people are looking. 

And when you're not visible where they're looking at your competition is, guess who's getting new business.

Them. Not you.

Ranking on the first page of Google and Google Maps for local keywords is the different between your business flourishing or dying.

## Your design / message doesn't align with your customers

There's nothing more painful to see than looking at a website that is tone-deaf to their audience.

As a business, your website's job needs to properly align with the needs and wants that your customers are looking for.

For example - say you're a local landscaper and you want only high-end customers. Imagine your website looks sketchy, messy and all over the place. Guess who isn't getting high-end customers?

Your website's design and overall message needs to cater to the audience you're trying to pull in. If it doesn't, you won't be getting any new leads.

## Final thoughts

If your website isn't bringing you any new customers, chances are it's because it's not setup to convert, it doesn't rank well in Google and even if it does - your design / messaging doesn't align with your customers.
