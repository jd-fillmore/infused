A big part in finding the best SEO keywords for plumbers comes down to a couple things:

* What are your customers searching for, in terms of your specific service?
* What city are you located in?

Since local [search engine optimization](https://infused.agency/seo/) is going to be so huge for you plumbing businesses (since you offer a local service), it's super important to build an [SEO keyword strategy](infused.agency/seo) for your business. The entire point of SEO is inbound marketing - that is, to bring clients that are looking for what you offer, directly to you.

SEO for plumbers works so well because even when times are tough - recessions, slow times - it doesn't matter. You're tapping into a market that's outside of your network (people you don't know), who are looking for exactly what you offer.

## So.. what are the best SEO keywords for plumbers?

In this short post, we'll go through some SEO keywords that are the best to use for plumbers and plumbing companies.

## "CITY + plumber"

You'll notice a pattern as we go through these keywords.

Since most plumbers deal with clients locally, you will want to target local people that are searching for your services.

If you're in Toronto, you want to show up when someone searches "Toronto plumbers".

If you're in Los Angeles, "plumbers LA" or "Los Angeles plumbers".

These are a bit harder to rank for, because they're such generic terms. Not to mention, since every other plumbers is using SEO to try and rank for that keyword, it's super competitive.

Which leads us to something called a long-tail keyword.

## "Best plumbing company + CITY"

Long tail keywords are usually phrases of four or more words. These are so much easier to rank for in Google because they're longer phrases, therefore they're less competitive in nature.

Below, we'll dive even deeper or go into what's known as "buyer's intent" when it comes to searching.

## "plumbers in CITY"

A lot of people when they search locally for a service they need, they'll be very specific in their search. They'll narrow down to the city they're in, or the type of service they need. Not just a general service.

It's been proven that the more specific that a search term is, the more intent there is for a person to buy.

## "CITY + commercial plumbing company"

You can see the same sort of effect being played out above.

I'm in Toronto (City) looking to get a bathroom done in a commercial building (commercial) and looking for a company (plumbing company) to do it.

The more specific the search, the more ready-to-buy your customers are.

## "plumbers near me"

This one is a bit funny.

A lot of people surprisingly use this search term. It's pretty difficult to rank for - but if you can, you're tapping into a fairly large market of people using SEO to search for what you offer.

## "Best plumbing company + CITY"

Not only is there intent in this search, but you know they're not tire kickers.

When someone uses words like "Best", you know that they know that with that, comes money to spend. Which is great for you.
