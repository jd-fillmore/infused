Some of the best <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer">SEO</a> strategies any business can use in 2021 are right under your nose, and relatively easy for a <a href="https://infused.agency/">professional</a> to take care of for you.

(Well, sort of).

You just have to know what those are!

Lets go through 11<!--more--> of the best <span style="font-size: 1rem;">SEO strategies for 2021.</span>

<h2>1. Make your site blazing fast</h2>

Google is all about pleasing it's users. A big part of that, is not having anyone on the internet wait a long time for anything to load up.

Imagine how frustrated you get clicking on a website, and having it take more than 3 seconds to load.

And that's just you - how do you think everyone else feels?! They feel the exact same.

Google has <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed publicly </a> that one of it's biggest factors in ranking any website, is fast page speed loading times. You have to optimize all of your images, all of your coding scripts and all of your pages in general.

One of the best tools to run your website through, would be <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google PageSpeed Insights</a>. It will give you a clear cut path in terms of where you need improvement. It will even give you your optimized images, JS and CSS files. Nice that it does some heavy lifting for you!

<h2>2. Your website must be mobile-friendly</h2>

The fact of the matter is, it's 2021. Everyone and their <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2017/05/17/technology-use-among-seniors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer">grandfather now has a smart phone</a>, so that means your website <em>must </em>be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Web" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer">mobile-friendly</a>.

Google had come out and announced way back in 2015 that mobile-friendly websites will be <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-boost-mobile-friendly-algorithm-coming-may-244941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer">favoured and rank higher</a> compared to those websites that are not mobile-friendly.

They did this because the vast majority of people browsing the web, are doing so on their phones. And since Google wants everyone to have a seamless experience on the web, it's a must that all websites must have be mobile-friendly in order to serve that specific purpose.

One super easy way to find out if your website is mobile-friendly, is to use the <a href="https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Mobile-Friendly Test</a>. The test is pretty quick and you'll know immediately if you have to make changes.

<h2>3. Use long-tail keywords in your SEO strategies</h2>

Lets say you own a company that sells sports shoes. And lets say your company is based in Toronto, Ontario.

If your goals is to organically rank your website, or a page on your website for, "sports shoes" - I'll tell you right now that probably won't happen. Sports shoes is so vague, and you'll be competing on a global scale with companies like Nike, Reebok, Adidas, and more. These companies have the resources to pour millions into their SEO campaigns.

However..

If you niche down, and try to rank for a longer search term such as, "kids sports shoes in Toronto", that will be much easier to rank for as there's not nearly as many companies trying to rank for a longer, more specific phrase.

These types of phrases are known as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/long-tail-keywords" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer">long tail keywords</a>. They have less search volume, but they have a much, much higher conversion rate. Why is that?

Because the<strong> more specific people go into the searches, the more ready-to-buy they become.</strong>

So, lets recap:

<ul>
 	<li>Long tail keywords are easier to rank for than shorter tail keywords</li>
 	<li>They have a higher conversion, because they cater to a more specific search term</li>
 	<li>These people are ready to buy</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Produce high-quality, in-depth content</h2>

&nbsp;

There's a few clients that have come to me in the past, wherein they are not seeing any sort of increasing in their SEO rankings. One of the 200 ranking factors that Google takes into account in order to rank a website, is that of producing <a href="https://moz.com/blog/google-fresh-factor-new" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer">high quality, fresh, in-depth content</a>.

Keyword: <strong>in-depth.</strong>

We're not taking about posting a 200-300 word blog post, with zero on-page SEO strategy taken into account.

We're talking about blog posts that are, at the very least, <strong>1,000 - 2,000 words </strong>or more. In depth, valuable content that people would want to share and link to.

That's the way to blog. That's one of the best ways to slowly inch up in the search engines.

Of course, there are a ton of other off page factors that do help in your SEO strategy to climb the ranks. Not just blogging.

<h2>5. Update old blog posts to include in your SEO strategies</h2>

This one is absolutely huge to include in your <a href="https://infused.agency/seo/">SEO strategies</a>, especially if you have a fair amount of blog posts that are able to be updated on a year to year basis.

This post, is a shining example. I'm posting it in the year 2021, but I will be re-purposing it for the year 2021 when that year comes, and adjust the content accordingly.

You can still rank <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/increase-seo-traffic-updating-thickening-old-blog-posts/191891/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer">very well</a>, and you are still updating your site with fresh, relevant and educational content. It's a win-win for your users, and in Google's eyes!

<h2>6. Engage in quality link-building</h2>

<em>Quality, </em>not quantity link-building, is extremely important to include in your SEO strategies.

What is link-building?

In a very small nutshell, lets say we design and build a website for a client, and we place a link at the bottom of their page that says, "web design by <a href="https://infused.agency/websites">Infused</a>."

And as you can see, with the word Infused, there's a link back to our website.

That's all a back link is! It's getting a link from one source, and having that link point back to your website.

These links are extremely important when it comes to ranking in Google.

"So, what you're saying is, just get a bunch of random websites point back to mine, and I'll rank well?"

<strong>No.</strong>

You need <strong>relevant </strong>links from <b>highly authoritative </b>websites point back to your site, to see any sort of actual leverage and ultimately bump your website up in Google.

Example - lets say you own a bakery and want to get some relevant, high quality back-links as part of your SEO strategies in order to beat out your <a href="/posts/how-can-i-improve-my-local-seo-results/">local</a> (or even non-local) competitors.

What would be the better back-link to get:

<ul>
 	<li>A back-link from John's shoe store, and John's shoe store has an old, non mobile-friendly layout?</li>
 	<li>Or from a highly regarded, relevant food blog online, that has a massive following (highly authoritative)?</li>
</ul>
Obviously the latter!

That's where we want to focus on getting back-links from.

Now, this is not easy. Or else everyone and their brother, sister, etc would be getting all of these highly relevant, highly authoritative back links all the time.

There's a few ways on how to get good at getting these links, and I may go in depth on exactly how to do that in the future.

<h2>7. Switch your website over to https://</h2>

Google wants all of it's users to feel 100% secure, <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-is-requiring-https-for-secure-data-in-chrome/183756/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer">especially in 2021</a> when browsing any sort of website on the internet.

In the link in the previous sentence, you'll see that Google pushes hard for this. It's actually one of the top ranking factors when it comes to getting your website to rank high in Google, is switching it over to https:// over http://.

The reason why this is being pushed so hard, is because the internet as a whole (including users, and large companies), want to make sure your information is as secure as possible.

And one of the best ways to ensure that this happens, is essentially having Google force people in the direction of making their websites https:// secure.

In my opinion, it's a great thing to do - not only for your business, but to ensure your client's information is secure as well.

<h2>8. Make your social media presence stronger</h2>

Now this point, is <a href="https://moz.com/blog/your-guide-to-social-signals-for-seo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer">absolutely huge.</a>

Another ranking factor that Google takes into account is how active and engaging your are with your audience, on social media platforms.

If you're active on your social media accounts, by posting, engaging in comments with your audience - and if people are actually liking, sharing and commenting on the posts you're making, that sends a "social signal" to Google that people actually <em>like </em>you. That people actually find your information relevant and valuable.

Now, solely doing this won't in itself boost rankings. But it definitely does help in your over SEO strategies to do so.

<h2>9. Don't forget about Bing and Yahoo</h2>

At this specific point in time, Google does own <a href="https://netmarketshare.com/search-engine-market-share.aspx?options=%7B%22filter%22%3A%7B%22%24and%22%3A%5B%7B%22deviceType%22%3A%7B%22%24in%22%3A%5B%22Desktop%2Flaptop%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D%2C%22dateLabel%22%3A%22Trend%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%22share%22%2C%22group%22%3A%22searchEngine%22%2C%22sort%22%3A%7B%22share%22%3A-1%7D%2C%22id%22%3A%22searchEnginesDesktop%22%2C%22dateInterval%22%3A%22Monthly%22%2C%22dateStart%22%3A%222017-02%22%2C%22dateEnd%22%3A%222018-01%22%2C%22segments%22%3A%22-1000%22%7D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer">74.52%</a> of the search engine market share. In a nut shell, the majority of people do use Google, whenever they intently search for a product or service that they're currently in need for.

However..

Yahoo and Bing own collectively, almost 14%.

On a local, or even a global scale, that's a HUGE number. In the millions.

So, don't forget to optimize your site for Yahoo and Bing as well! Signing up for both webmaster tools for both platforms would be a great start.

<h2>10. Concentrate hugely on User Experience (UX) as part of your SEO strategies</h2>

This is the future of search engine optimization, by a long shot.

In fact, it's already in practice. It's been shown that the longer your audience stays on a particular page of your website, the more valuable it is. Meaning, if Google knows a lot of people are reading your content, and staying longer on your site, then it must mean your website is valuable.

And what do valuable websites do?

They climb in the ranks!

Making sure that you deliver engaging content, and that your reads love reading it (and keep coming back), is absolutely huge for your online presence.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Doing just one, or two, or three of these things for your SEO strategies will not concretely help you rank better. You have to do everything at once, on a consistent month to month basis to see any sort of increase for your online Google presence.
