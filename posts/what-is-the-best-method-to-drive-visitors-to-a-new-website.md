<h2>How to drive massive traffic to your website</h2>

Without further ado, lets attempt to answer the question with practical answers, “What is the best method to drive visitors to a new website?”.

<h3>Google My Business</h3>

One of the best ways on how to get traffic to your website fast, is using something called <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_ca/business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google My Business</a>.

What is Google My Business?

If you own a local business, it is absolutely imperative to setup an account. It allows you to get on a local map pack that shows up whenever you use Google to search for something. It's the same place where people can write Google Reviews about your business.

Once you setup a My Business account, it's so important that you starting getting past customers or past clients to write 5 star reviews on how much of a great job you've done for them.

Once you get a bunch of reviews, you will notice that over time your Google My Business page will rise in the local map pack. So when people search for whatever you're offering, you'll notice a big spike in free traffic. This is one of the best methods to drive visitors to a new website.
<h3>Search Engine Optimization</h3>

<a href="https://infused.agency/search-engine-optimization/">Search Engine Optimization</a> (the short form being SEO) is the process that affects your online visibility, for when people search for you on Google.

For example - if you're in Toronto and own a shoe sort, when people search, "Shoe Store Toronto" in Google, ideally you want to show up on the first page of Google. Reason being, that's where people land, and that's where people ultimately click on a business' website and buy product from.

One of the best ways to increase website traffic through Google, is through having great search engine optimization on your website. I'll tell you what's not as good - having a website that has zero search engine optimization on it. I can't tell you how many times I've seen company websites that are amazing (a great user experience, very well designed), but don't rank at all in Google for any keywords whatsoever.

If you want people with the intent to buy to come to your website, using search engine optimization is one of the best methods to drive visitors to your new website.
<h3>List Your Site On Relevant Or Local Directories</h3>

Another great way on how to get traffic to your website fast is leveraging the strategy of listing your website on relevant or local directories.

What is a directory?

Simply put, it's a list of either local companies, or relevant companies that offer a service. A lot of the time, they can be both, which is a bonus.

This is amazing especially for local search engine optimization, because in order to rank locally in the Google Map Pack, you need to list your business name, phone number and address on a bunch of different directories.

Some great local directories to get you started are:
<ul>
 	<li>Yelp</li>
 	<li>Facebook</li>
 	<li>YellowPages</li>
 	<li>Apple Maps</li>
 	<li>Bing</li>
 	<li>Yahoo</li>
</ul>

Another set of directories that you should definitely consider are relevant directories.

For example, say you're a shoe store and want to get on some relevant directories. Simply Google "shoe store directory" and Google will give you back a bunch of relevant directories to that business.

Get your business up on those relevant directories and that's another great way of how to drive massive traffic to your website.

Once you list your business name, phone number and physical address on these sites, don't forget to put a link back to your website! This is great for SEO.

Putting your website's information on these local and relevant directories can be amazing ways to drive visitors to a new website.
<h3>Post To Social Media</h3>

Another great way to drive visitors to a new website is to post on social media!

Use free platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn to give value to your customers. For example - any time I write a blog post such as this one, I'll share it on LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. It's all about giving value, and this is not only an amazing way to give value, but it's also one of the best methods to drive visitors to a new website.

Also, for maximum visibility, don't forget to use relevant hashtags! Make sure your hashtags are of course relevant, but if you're a local business, use local hashtags as well.

People search for these hashtags and you'll come up for them when you use them. It's a great way to expand outreach.
<h3>Email Marketing</h3>

Another great way to drive quick and free traffic to your website, is through email marketing.

How do you build an email list?

One of the most simple ways in doing so, is having your potential customers opt in through email, in getting some of value from you, for free.

For example, you can offer a quick, free PDF on how your business can help them.

Once you have those people on your email list, you can email them once a week and nurture that list!

A great way is by writing blog posts once a week and sending weekly updates. Or, if you have any special offers, you can email those too to your customers. Nurturing long term relationships with prospects and customers is one of the best ways to drive massive traffic to your website.
<h3>Engage Your Audience Online</h3>

Another great way in how to get traffic to your website fast, is through engaging your audience online.

What does that mean, though?

One great way is to join relevant Facebook groups and answer questions that people may have. So for example, if you're a landscaper, join 2-3 landscaping groups. If you see potential customers asking questions, answer those questions!

You'll soon become to go-to authority on the subject. Soon, you'll have people contacting you privately, asking to take on new projects. It's an amazing strategy.
<h3>Conclusion on what is the best method to drive visits to a new website..</h3>

There's no one best method to drive visits to a new website.

However, with the combination of the methods above, I guarantee you that you will end up with a boat load of massive traffic coming to your website.

The only investment here, is time. And the time is well worth it!
