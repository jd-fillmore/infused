As a [Niagara web design](https://infused.agency/) company, we've had a few [local companies](https://infused.agency/kd-flowers) come to us and ask, "Should I use WordPress for my new website?".

This is kind of a loaded question as WordPress is really good at doing some things, but not so good at doing other things.

In this post, we'll go through when it's a good time to use WordPress for your new website, and whether choosing a different platform may suit your company better.

**TL;DR - should you use WordPress for your new website?**

* **It depends on the needs of the company**
* **Is there an actual need to manage the content? Then use WordPress**
* **Do you want to explore different CMS options that are more modern? Maybe don't use WordPress**
* **Is your website outside of the scope of what a simple CMS offers? Don't use WordPress**
* **Do you need a web application versus a website? Don't use WordPress**

## Should I Use WordPress For My New Website?

Before we dive into whether you should use WordPress for your new website, lets answer a few vital questions as it pertains to WordPress.

## What is WordPress?

[WordPress](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/) is the world's most popular content management system. A content management system (CMS) allows people that don't know how to code, to go in and manage the content of their website.

There's a lot of great use-cases for WordPress. For simple, informational-type websites - or even simple e-commerce websites -  it's an amazing tool to utilize. 

However for anything outside of that scope, it's arguably not the right tool for the job. 

## What makes WordPress good?

There's a plethora of (relatively) plug-and-play extensions called "plugins". For example - if you want your website to load faster, there's a plugin for that. If you want to add a shop or e-commerce functionality to your website, there's a plugin for that too!

This allows developers to save time, which helps cut down on costs for both development time and also time charged to clients.

## What makes WordPress bad?

Every platform, including [modern headless CMS](https://jamstack.org/headless-cms/)' have their pros and cons.

Security is a big concern for using WordPress. Since WordPress is by far the most widely used content management system (at this time) on the planet, hackers by nature go after it a lot more than other platforms. However - having daily website backups, coupled with security plugins and maintenance in place can greatly reduced your WordPress website from being hacked.

WordPress' bloat is often another red flag for developers building with WordPress. Now - you can absolutely cleanly build a WordPress website as a developer, as we do. However there are a lot of bad practices that some agencies do, at least from a development standpoint. The biggest one is using pre-made templates that they buy and "developing" the website that way. They don't actually "develop" the website at all - they use drag and drop blocks to arrange elements on each web page. This is bad as this is what causes a WordPress website to bloat up with terrible code. Avoid these at all costs.

## Use cases for using WordPress

Like mentioned above, there's a lot of scenarios where WordPress is an amazing tool to utilize. 

Use WordPress when your website...

* Is simple in functionality, meaning brochure or informational. Simply displaying information with contact or lead generation forms.
* Needs extended functionality that can cover general basis - email opt-in forms, contact forms, small e-commerce shop.
* Needs the ability for you to manage your own content without knowing code
* Your website is not too big in terms of page size

If your website falls into this general area, then WordPress is an amazing tool.

## Use cases against using WordPress

Some of the time however, WordPress is definitely not the tool to be reached for.

When your website...

* Is not actually a website, but a web application. Websites like YouTube, Spotify, Facebook etc. fall into this category. They're complex in nature and far outside the scope of WordPress.
* Requires functionality like CRUD (create, read, update, delete). For example a job board, dashboard functionality, management software, etc.
* Doesn't need someone to manage it without the knowledge of code
* Is a large, complex e-commerce store or a large website in general
* When you want to utilizing a headless CMS

If your website or web application falls into these general areas, it's best not to use WordPress. It's best to choose the right tool for the job that's outside of the scope of what WordPress is great at.

## Final thoughts on should you use WordPress for your new website

Choosing the right tool for the job when it comes to your new website is very, very important.

Is it not complex, informational and you want to have the ability to edit the site without code knowledge?

WordPress is great.

Is your website super complex in functionality, acts more like a web application than an informational website?

Choose something other than WordPress!
